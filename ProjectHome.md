<h1>Flight Map: Cleared for open source.</h1>

Flight Map is an Android app for pilots and aviation enthusiasts. It provides a moving map of airports in your vicinity as well as speed, altitude and heading and is designed to work without a data network connection. Flight Map offers detailed airport information by tapping on any airport displayed onscreen.<br>
<br>
Born of Google "20% time," a team of employees who are pilots and aviation enthusiasts built this initial public release which is currently available in the Android Marketplace. The basics are there now: vector-based rendering of airport symbols, Class B/C/D US airspace, and airport & facility information from official FAA sources in a downloadable, auto-updating database.<br>
<br>
But the best part about Flight Map? <b>You</b>, you big lug. It's designed to be easily extended by anyone who wants to add additional moving map layers, airport and navaid information, and navigational features to the application. Some ideas:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Use publicly available FAA chart data to plot current position over real VFR sectional and terminal area charts</li></ul>

<ul><li>Add a "glide halo" to estimate range of emergency landing area at current altitude</li></ul>

<ul><li>Augmented reality: plot nearby airports on your Android device's camera view.</li></ul>
